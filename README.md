The set of analyses within this repository were conducted on distance ratings data from independent participants on an online platform called Meadows ([www.meadows-research.com]).

Subjects performed a behavioral multi-arrangement task on the full stimulus set. The stimulus set consisited of 12 categories with 15 word examples from each category. For each category, all 15 items were arranged as labels around a white circle which was in the center of the screen. 
Subjects were instructed to arrange these items based on their subjective opinion of how similar they thought these items were. The more similar the items were, the closer they were placed in space on the circle. Each round terminated once the participant pressed submit. 

After completion of the experiment, I produced a behavioural representational dissimilarity matrix by computing the pairwise squared on-screen distances between the arranged concepts. Based on these matrices, I calculated the average distance ratings produced by the 10 participants for each unique pair of items for each category.
